# Hi, there! 👋

I'm Mihai, a 35-year-old Tech enthusiast, DevOps engineer at IBM, and HAM Radio hobbyist with the callsign YO3ISL. I have a strong passion for all things related to infrastructure management, automation, and the transformative power of technology. 🖥️ 🚀

My expertise spans a range of technologies including Ansible, Proxmox, Linux VM servers, and some Python coding. My love for tech extends into my personal life, where I run a Proxmox cluster powered by 3 x HP Gen8 servers with CEPH, running a multitude of automations. This allows me to experiment and stay on top of current tech trends.

When I'm not working, you can find me tweaking my home setup, or reaching out to the world through my HAM radio. 📡🌍

Feel free to explore my repositories or get in touch, let's make the digital world a better place, one commit at a time. Happy coding! 👨‍💻
